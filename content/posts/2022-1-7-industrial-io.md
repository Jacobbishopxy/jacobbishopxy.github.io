## Intro

Hello everyone, today I'm going to use MongoDB as a Graph database to implement a real world project. Here is the [project address](https://github.com/Jacobbishopxy/industrial-io), and meanwhile I'm going to show you how to use frontend web application to interact with the database. Furthermore, I'll introduce how to write proc-macro in Rust-lang. This project needs a long term maintenance, since I'm not a fulltime Rust developer, and I need more time to learn Rust as well. Hope you like it, and leave a issue if you have any suggestion.
