Hello everyone, today I'm going to start a new project demonstrating how to build a microservices system. `React`, `Golang`, `Grpc`, `Rust`, `Redis`, `Mongo` and maybe more will be used in this scenario. The reason why I choose these tech stacks is because I really like Golang and Rust :), and I wish I could use them to partially replace my previous work, which is done by `Python` and `NodeJs`.

Obviously, for quick production's sake, `Python` and `NodeJs` are very friendly and easy to use, but as the time goes when the whole system is getting larger and larger, it starts getting loss of control. There are many reasons I have to refactor my project, such as single threaded backend services, loose project management, weak language type and etc, but for now these issuses are not what we ought to concern. Let's go back to our topic and before we get our hands wet, there are few prerequisites that we need to notice.

Before we start, I have to mention that due to my job requirement, always dealing with Office softwares, I have to use Windows as my working environment. Therefore I use WSL2(Ubuntu) + Windows Docker Desktop + VsCode as my dev env to get rid of cross-platform headache.

## Prerequisites

### VsCode

### NPM or Yarn

### Go

### GRPC

We need a code generate tool called `protoc`, which will be used to generate our Golang code.

Thanks to [google.github.io/proto-lens](http://google.github.io/proto-lens/installing-protoc.html), who makes the whole process way easier. By simply using `sudo apt install -y protobuf-compiler` command, we can not install the latest version. And moreover, it could drive you crazy, because later on you would find that dependencies like `import "google/protobuf/timestamp.proto";` cannot be found!. This is because the default folder is not in the right position.

To install `protoc` cli, visit [protobuf release page](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) and choose the latest one (the current latest ver. is `3.17.3`), then:

```sh
PROTOC_ZIP=protoc-3.17.3-linux-x86_64.zip

curl -OL https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v3.17.3/$PROTOC_ZIP

sudo unzip -o $PROTOC_ZIP -d /usr/local bin/protoc

sudo unzip -o $PROTOC_ZIP -d /usr/local 'include/*'

rm -f $PROTOC_ZIP

sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local/include/google/
```

Notice the last line may not be required, since the folder permission should have been permitted for us.

### Rustc and Cargo

### Docker
